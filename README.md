Responsive Landing Page

This project is a simple, responsive landing page built using HTML and CSS as part of my web development internship task.
The page includes a structured header, an engaging hero section with a call-to-action button, and a clean footer.

It is designed with a soft pink, feminine aesthetic that reflects a modern and creative personal brand style. The layout uses Flexbox for alignment and media queries for responsiveness, ensuring that the page adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.

Overall, this project demonstrates my understanding of semantic HTML, responsive design principles, and modern UI styling using pure CSS.
